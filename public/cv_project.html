        <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
        <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. You mean it controls your actions? Your eyes can deceive you. <strong> Don't trust them.</strong> <em> A tremor in the Force.</em> The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
        <h2>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</h2>
        <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. As you wish. What?! Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</li><li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li><li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</h3>
        <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>

        <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
        <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
        <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
        <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I call it luck. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>
        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
        <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
        <p>As you wish. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Red Five standing by. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
        <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦</p>
        <p>What!? Ye-ha! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
