    The Series follows a boy that was given a difficult fate since he was born. 
    He Needs to beat a scary overlord that constantly trying to murder him. 
    And he needs to fight it without the love of his parents.
    The only thing that keeps harry from giving up was the friends and companions during his studies.
    He ended up as a hero for future generations and idol for many people.

    The reason why i think this is one of the greatest movie of all time is because i like how they show the POVs.
    From one side there's this super rich person that extravagantly spend his earnings for parties that he never went to most of the time. 
    We get to see from his view on  who he actually is. i like how that sometimes it only depend on one choice when we try to do something 
    and from one side is the view of an outsider that suddenly is introduce to this new life and how he sees it in a very distant yet participating way.
